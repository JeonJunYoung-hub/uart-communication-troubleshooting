## Troubleshooting Case Study

### Initial Symptom

- LED panels powered on but displayed nothing.
- No visible rendering despite active UART transmission.

---

### Initial Hypotheses

1. Ground wiring issue
2. Voltage instability
3. Logic level mismatch
4. RGB matrix shield configuration error
5. Faulty LED panels

---

### Hardware Verification

- TX voltage measured: ~3.3V (stable)
- Supply voltage measured: ~4V (expected drop from 5V via breadboard)
- Ground continuity verified
- Metro M4 and RGB Matrix Shield confirmed functional
- LED panels confirmed operational using alternative test code

Conclusion: Hardware was not the issue.

### Root Cause Analysis

The failure originated from UART data handling logic.

The original implementation parsed incoming UART data immediately using comma-based splitting:

```python
data_list = data_string.split(",")
